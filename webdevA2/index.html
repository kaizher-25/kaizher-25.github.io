                    <h2>Invention of the game</h2>
                    <p>Basketball was invented in December of 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian-American PE teacher. He was asked to create an indoor sport game that help athletes keep fit in cold weather by his boss. And he created basketball.</p>

                    <h2>The first basketball game</h2>
                    <p>On December 21, 1891, James Naismith introduced a new game with five basic ideas and thirteen rules, which later became known as basketball. The first match was played with 9 players on each team using a soccer ball and peach baskets as goals. One student, Frank Mahan, jokingly reacted to the new game, and when naming it, Naismith suggested "basketball."
                    The first game ended 1â€“0, with William R. Chase scoring the only goal. Notable players included John G. Thompson, Frank Mahan, and others. Early versions of the game had key differences, such as closed peach baskets that required manually retrieving the ball. Metal hoops, nets, and backboards were added in 1906, and by 1894, a proper basketball was developed with the help of Spalding.</p>

                    <p>The Basketball Association of America (BAA) was founded on June 6, 1946, in New York City.[36] The league adopted the name National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949 after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL). As of the early 21st century, the NBA is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.</p>

            <h2>Naismith's original rules</h2>
            <p>
                There were only thirteen rules of "basket ball":<br><br>
                1. The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.<br><br>
                2. The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.<br><br>
                3. A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.<br><br>
                4. The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.<br><br>
                5. No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.<br><br>
                6. A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.<br><br>
                7. If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents.<br><br>
                8. A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.<br><br>
                9. When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The "thrower-in" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.<br><br>
                10. The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.<br><br>
                11. The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.<br><br>
                12. The time shall be fifteen-minute halves, with five-minute rests between.<br><br>
                13. The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.
